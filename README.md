<i>[2021-12-09] On my system, the property in the Windows Application is always empty! What is wrong?</i>

I am using Thinfinity VirtualUI version 3.0.7.103.<br>
Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition.<br>
Windows 10.<br>

<b>Requirement:</b>
  The windows application must serve the JSRO javascript.<br>
  The reason is, if we must change the JSRO javascript code for a new version of our Application,<br>
  we cannot be frequently changing the app.html file in C:\Program Files\Thinfinity\VirtualUI\web.<br>
  Our IT requires new versions of applications to be drop in replacements of our binaries.<br>
  We do not want modify code outside of our application directories.<br>
